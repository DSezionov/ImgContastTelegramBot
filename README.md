Hello everyone!  
I would like to introduce you to the code of an image processing bot, namely, changing the contrast of a photo.  
This bot was created for the Telegram messenger.  To use it, the user needs to load an image into it and specify a numerical value from 1 to 10, which will select the appropriate filter and send the image to the user.  Also, an experienced user has the ability to independently choose the contrast value and more flexibly change the final image.  The code was created using the pyTelegramBotAPI library.
